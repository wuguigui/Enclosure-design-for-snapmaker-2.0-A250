# Enclosure-design-for-snapmaker-2.0-A250
This is an enclosure designed for snapmaker 2.0, A250, now it only have a basic frame and 2 doors, I still working on the cooling fan and vacuuming system for CNC part, so far itâ€™s working well to reduce the noise, which distresses me a lot these days.
The main structure is Aluminum profile(4040&2020), other parts can be print out by A250 easily, with some screw bolts and acrylic panels, you can make a nice enclosure by yourself.
See the ASSEMBLY MANUAL to get more information.[ASSEMBLY MANUAL.pdf](https://github.com/wuguigui/Enclosure-design-for-snapmaker-2.0-A250/files/6136687/ASSEMBLY.MANUAL.pdf)
